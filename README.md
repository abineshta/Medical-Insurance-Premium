#  Insights
- The company has huge number of clients at the age between 40 to 60 and 20 to 40 in descending order. Company has a huge market to tap into clients of age between 0 to 20 and 60 to 80. There could be a chance that the current policy is attractive for the age bracket of 20 to 60 and not for others.

- The people who is 20 years of age can be found for policy rate of Rs 15,000 as well for for policy rate more than Rs 35,000. So, in conclusion it is not just the age but so many other factors like illness could impact the premium.

- Surprisingly we have clients mostly from the side of blood pressure problems and diabetes. We are lacking to cover more clients who are affected with certain allergies and chronic diseases. There is a chance that the insurance policy provided by the company does not cover the provide riders that involve known allergies and any chronic disease. Including these two problems as a rider will attract furthermore clients towards this company.

- The company is charging too high premium price for the policy holders with known allergy and chronic diseases. Policies with diabetes and blood pressure problems are charged very less. Only few people are charged high in the case of diabetes and blood pressure, which is regarded as an outlier.

-  There are greater variations in the number of clients who are paying the premiums for policy. Surprisingly, so the people have subscribed the policy rate of Rs.23000. This depicts the companies poor standards of setting policy rate according to the services they offer and more oover some form of partiality for that particular policy.
- The pricing method used according to the number of major surgeries is appreciable and can be considered that factor too. As the number of surgeries increase for a client, the policy rate charged on average also increases. However, there is no great difference between 2 and 3 surgeries. A slight increase in the premium price for people with 3 surgeries might act as a good pricing strategy.
## Conclusion
Company must start new schemes for the rest of the age groups which they failed to cover. Through this measure they can improve their market share for these market segments. If the trend in the past continues, we might lose even the current clients who have the illness of chronic and allergy as there is a huge premium charged over them compared to other two. They might switch to the competitor brands who provide the same policies for lesser price. Company must start reducing the policies premium price for these two diseases to attract new customers as well as holding the existing clients too.
